Hi, i am a youth student of cross-platform application development, i will share my exercises and projects on /DAM(Desarrollo de aplicaciones multiplataforma) repository. 

I am open to job offers or internships that allow me to continue learning and training as a developer as long as I can combine it with my studies. I study from 8:30 to 14:30.
